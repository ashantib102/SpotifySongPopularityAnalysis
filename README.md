# Spotify Song Popularity Analysis
Project Overview
For the final project in my CISC3225:Data Tools and Algorithm course at Brooklyn College, I analyzed  a dataset of approximately 114,000 spotify songs to uncover the factors influencing song popularity. Using Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and statistical testing methods (Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-Squared), I performed extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), cluster analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling. 

Key Steps
Data Preparation: Handled missing values, transformed data types, and prepared categorical variables for modeling using one-hot encoding.
Cluster Analysis: Applied K-Means clustering to identify distinct audio profiles within the dataset and visualized these clusters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Feature Engineering: Created categorical features representing the top 20 artists and genres, and transformed the duration variable using a logarithmic transformation.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Identified trends in song popularity across different genres, audio features, and categorical variables.
Model Development: Built Random Forest Regression models to predict song popularity based on both categorical and continuous variables. I then developed a Random Forest Classifier to predict broad song genres based on audio features.
Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using RÂ² scores for regression models and F1-scores for classification models. Conducted statistical tests (Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-Squared) to evaluate the significance of genre and explicit content on popularity.
